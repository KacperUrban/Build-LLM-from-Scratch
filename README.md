# Build-LLM-from-Scratch
This repo is a part of my study on LLMs based on great book from Sebastian Raschka "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)". I will upload all my code and experimantions into this repository. Code written from different chapter will be placed in each folder or different notebook. I will updated repo as things progress.
